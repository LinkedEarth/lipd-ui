- Full visual refresh: modern header, navigation panel, SectionCard container, compact DataTable grid
- Read-only mode improvements: aligned label/value pairs, enum chips, hyperlink lists with bullets
- Responsive layout tweaks across LiPDApp and demo
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` to avoid committing `node_modules` and build artefacts

### Changed
- Switched legacy `<fieldset>` containers to new `SectionCard` component
- Reduced tree navigation font size and spacing, added dynamic labels for PaleoData/ChronData, Calibration, and Interpretation items
- DataGrid now mimics spreadsheet look with dense rows and bold uppercase headers

### Fixed
